        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>In this project, I created a cloth simulator that followed the laws of physics and created realistic folds, bends and billows. You can essentially think of this project as two major components. The first is a set of rules for the physics of the cloth (particularly the kinematics/motion), as set up in part 1 and expanded upon in part 2. It taught me to think of this cloth structure as a lattice of springs between point masses, a “mesh” which has the cloth texture placed over it. In parts 3 and 4, I allowed this mesh to interact with the world and itself, such that the cloth realistically draped over surfaces or folded on itself when it fell. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The second component is shaders, as done in part 5. Though technically light is physics, this moved away from the kinematics from before into a study of how to determine texture and color. From the three light components of a Blinn-Phong to the actual geometric changes of Displacement shaders, these shaders made the cloth look more realistic.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Overall, I think this was my favorite project, mostly because I love animation and movement. It was also nice to sort of have these physics equations beforehand and just kind of plug them in; it felt much more straightforward than mapping out through edges and half-edges as was done in other projects…</p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and Springs</h3>
	<p>As you can see, our cloth wireframe is a grid of point masses interconnected by strings to represent various movement types: Structural, Shearing, and Bending. Some of these point masses are “pinned” in place, but many move as the simulation progresses following the three types of springs set up. The following image shows the wireframe’s lattice of springs with different constraints applied:</p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via Numerical Integration</h3>
        <p>This integration allows for the springs in the cloth to behave realistically in the scene, making the lattice, well, cloth-like. Fortunately for us, we can change some variables around to change the properties of this cloth and the way it interacts with the scene, shown primarily through these three variables:</p>
        <p>SPRING CONSTANT: Increasing the spring constant makes a “stiffer” spring that requires more force to be pulled or compressed. At lower spring constants, the cloth is not stiff at all, and drapes significantly due to gravitational forces. At high spring constants, the cloth doesn’t drape as much due to gravity, with a more sturdy lattice between the fixed points.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>DENSITY: Raising density has a similar effect to decreasing the spring constant: denser cloth drapes more and has a more bent/draping lattice. This makes sense: the force of gravity is greater on denser cloth, because the acceleration from gravity is constant.  At low density, the cloth barely drapes and seems rather flat. At high density, the cloth drapes significantly (all else equal, of course).</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>DAMPING: Raising the damping percentage allows the cloth to wave around less, coming to a stop sooner and acting like a “parachute”. This makes sense: if damping represents forces like friction and air resistance on the cloth, more resistance applied will stop the bouncing/billowing of the cloth made by the force of gravity. With a very high damping percentage, the cloth falls very slowly but stops almost immediately once it reaches the rest position, and at very low damping, it swings back and forth for a very long time (indefinitely, I assume, at 0 damping)</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The following images document changes in spring constant, density, and damping:</p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Collisions with Other Objects</h3>
        <p>Collisions with other objects (either “spheres” or “planes”) are not terribly hard to do. We essentially see where the cloth would intersect with the object and then “bump it up” to the surface as if that surface is exerting the normal force that it would exert in the physical world. This will cause a cloth on the sphere to drape over it, as the gravity of the scene pulls the parts not stopped by the cloth down. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Of course, the spring constant (ks) greatly affects this. Higher spring constants make the cloth more rigid, and it doesn’t fall quite as much and is less shaped by the sphere. At high ks, the cloth drapes at an angle and only really is flush with the very top of the sphere, whereas at low ks, the cloth drapes almost entirely downward because of the gravity and rests on much more of the sphere, almost flush with the entire top hemisphere of the sphere and moving directly downwards from there. In the “real world,” higher ks seems to represent a more sturdy or rigid body; a piece of printer paper, for example, might have a higher ks than a standard washcloth.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Density works inversely; the higher the density, the more the cloth drags itself down around the sphere. This also makes sense, because as mentioned before, the force of gravity is greater on the cloth, and better pulls down the points at the edges that don’t have a sphere to rest on.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Here are some images of all of this at different spring constants:</p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Self-collisions</h3>
	<p>The following images show how the cloth falls and folds. As the cloth falls, the bottom collides with the floor and begins to scrunch itself up. By the end, it lies relatively “flat” on the ground, with a few folds and creases leftover from how it fell. While the cloth folding in on itself is fairly realistic, it does sort of “bounce” when it should be flat on the floor because of collisions</p>

	<p></p>
	<p>Now, both density and spring constant affect this. Objects may fall at a constant acceleration (as they do in real life when negating air resistance), but spring constant affects how much (and how easily) the cloth folds on itself. With a higher spring constant, the final cloth state is more “scrunched up.” Similarly, denser cloth is more “scrunched up.”</p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders </h3>
        <p>A shader program allows us to quickly and efficiently render realistically shaded material appearances without using ray tracing or other complicated methods. We’re dealing with two basic shader types: Vertex shaders which apply transforms to geometric objects like modifying their position and normal vectors, and fragment shaders, which process the fragments left by rasterization using the geometric attributes of the fragments as calculated by the vertex shader, assigning color vectors to the pixels in the display to produce the appearance of different materials.</p>
        <p></p>
	<p>I made a few different types of shaders, but I’ll go into deeper detail on the Blinn-Phong shader. This shader separates the light of the scene into three types: </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>AMBIENT Light, which is just the light reflecting uniformly off of all surfaces in the scene. This is the “flat color” of objects in the scene without accounting for light fallout and the like; just the intensity times a constant. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>DIFFUSE Light, which uses Lambert’s Cosine Law and the illumination from the source (as it falls off over time) to shade, producing a matte appearance that’s brighter as the “diffuse coefficient” increases.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>And SPECULAR Reflections, which creates shading based on the viewer’s perspective (and a “halfway” vector that’s near the normals. This produces a gloss appearance with glare and lighter, reflective highlights as might be seen on metal or mirrors.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Blinn-Phong is the weighted sum of these components that mimics a material to be shaded: imitating metal, for example, will weigh the Specular Reflection component higher than a flat black piece of construction paper. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Here are a variety of shaders:</p>

	<p>The Bump Mapping and Displacement shaders produce fairly different results, with that difference exaggerated at low sample rates. Bump mapping creates bumps by modifying normal vectors and forcing the fragment shader to give the illusion of bumps and details. Meanwhile, Displacement modifies (or rather, displaces) the position of vertices to change the height map and then makes the normals consistent with this new geometry. In other words, Displacement creates actual bumps and changes in geometry that truly modify the shape (at low sampling rates, this can warp it significantly),  while Bump Mapping changes the normals to create the illusion of bumps through fragment shading while leaving the true height map the same.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>We can see how these two maps differ by comparing their performances at 16 by 16 and 128 by 128. At 16 by 16, bump mapping seems better, since the displacement map is weirdly warped and wavy, as if a cloth is wrapped around not a sphere, but the skeleton of one. In the 128 by 128 sample, the Bump Map stays similar (accurately spherical with contours) but the displacement mapping improves markedly: the sphere is clearly spherical, now just with “fuzzy” (or almost “fluffy”) edges that look more like a change in texture than shape (as it should). It kind of reminds me of one of those "fluffalos" that elementary schoolers use in gym class.</p>
